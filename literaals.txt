III. Boolean literals:

A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: True or False.

IV. Special literals.

Python contains one special literal i.e., None.

None is used to specify to that field that is not created. It is also used for end of lists in Python.


V.Literal Collections.

Collections such as tuples, lists and Dictionary are used in Python.

List:

List contain items of different data types. Lists are mutable i.e., modifiable.
The values stored in List are separated by commas(,) and enclosed within a square brackets([]). We can store different type of data in a List.
Value stored in a List can be retrieved using the slice operator([] and [:]).
The plus sign (+) is the list concatenation and asterisk(*) is the repetition operator.
