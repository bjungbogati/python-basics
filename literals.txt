Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to following four different numerical types.

Int Literals:

Numbers can be both positive and negative with no fractional part. They are also called signed integers.

Long Literals:

Integers of unlimited size followed by lowercase or uppercase L eg: 87032845L

Float Literals:

Real numbers with both integer and fractional part eg: -26.2

Complex Literals:

In the form of a+bj where a forms the real part and b forms the imaginary part of complex number. eg: 3.14j


Boolean Literals:

A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: True or False.


Special literals   ::   None

Python contains one special literal i.e., None.

None is used to specify to that field that is not created. It is also used for end of lists in Python.

Unicode literals  

 ::   u"hello"

Literal Collections

List literals

List contain items of different data types. Lists are mutable i.e., modifiable.


   ::   [], [5,6,7]
Tuple literals  

List contain items of different data types. Tuples are unmutable i.e., modifiable.

 ::   (), (9,),(8,9,0)
Dict literals  

List contain items of different data types. Lists are mutable i.e., modifiable.

 ::   {}, {'x':1}
Set literals  

 ::   {8,9,10}















String literals   ::   "halo" , '12345'

Numeric literals

	Int literals   ::   0,1,2,-1,-2
	Long literals   ::   89675L
	Float literals   ::   3.14
	Complex literals   ::   12j


Boolean literals   ::   True or False
Special literals   ::   None
Unicode literals   ::   u"hello"
List literals   ::   [], [5,6,7]
Tuple literals   ::   (), (9,),(8,9,0)
Dict literals   ::   {}, {'x':1}
Set literals   ::   {8,9,10}


Integer (can be both positive and negative) with no fractional part.
