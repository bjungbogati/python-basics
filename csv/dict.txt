Normal CSV file
Suppose, we have a csv file called people.csv with following data.

SN, Name, City

    reader = csv.reader(csvFile)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
        
csvFile.close()

The above program will output :

['SN', ' Name', ' City']
['1', ' Siddu', ' Winona']
['2', ' Dipika', ' Lalitpur']
